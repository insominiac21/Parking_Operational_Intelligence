# Parking Operational Intelligence Platform (POIP)

The **Parking Operational Intelligence Platform (POIP)** is a spatial intelligence and decision-support framework built for urban traffic enforcement. It transforms large-scale parking violation logs (298,450 records from Bengaluru) into a prioritized enforcement queue and dynamic zone governance strategies.

Designed for traffic police departments, smart-city planners, and GIS operators, POIP moves away from simple, misleading "violation count" heatmaps. Instead, it computes multidimensional obstruction indices, models congestion spillover across the road network, predicts future hotspot severities, and discovers spatial-behavioral archetypes to recommend targeted interventions.

## ⚡ Production-Grade Microservice Architecture (Dual-Backend)

To prevent RAM out-of-memory (OOM) errors and optimize hosting costs on free-tier services (which limit RAM to 512MB), POIP splits the backend load into two parallel web services managed by a single frontend:

1. **Primary Dashboard Backend**:
   - Handles KPIs, maps, forecast data, and network intelligence metrics.
   - Run via `requirements.txt` (extremely lightweight, loads in seconds, uses under 100MB of RAM).
2. **Semantic Search Backend**:
   - Handles natural-language queries by searching the vector index database.
   - Run via `requirements-semantic.txt` (includes the FAISS index database).
3. **Hugging Face API Embedding Offloading**:
   - Instead of loading the heavy `sentence-transformers` model locally (which uses ~1.2GB–1.5GB RAM and causes OOM crashes on free hosting), the backend makes an external API call to the **Hugging Face Inference API** using a secure `HF_TOKEN` to extract the 384-dimensional vector for `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
   - The backend then matches the vector against the local lightweight `faiss` index in milliseconds, keeping the entire pipeline vector-based, fast, and OOM-proof!
   - If the API is offline or the token is missing, the service automatically falls back to local models or a fast keyword-based text matcher.
4. **Vercel Reverse Proxy Routing**:
   - Vercel routes `/api/search` queries to the **Semantic Search Backend**, `/api/*` to the **Primary Backend**, and `/health/*` paths for centralized UptimeRobot monitoring.

## 🏗️ Workflow Architecture

POIP operates as a sequential analytics pipeline. High-volume, raw logs are processed through spatial, statistical, machine learning, and network layers, producing lightweight data artifacts that power a real-time interactive dashboard.

### Key Stages

1. **Spatial Discretisation & Cleaning**: Filters invalid GPS points and divides Bengaluru into H3 resolution-9 hexagonal cells ($\approx 174\text{m}$ edge length).
2. **Parking Obstruction Index (POI)**: A multiplicative severity score calculated per violation. It integrates vehicle footprint (e.g., bus vs. scooter), violation severity (e.g., double parking vs. no-parking zone), junction proximity, and local density.
3. **HDBSCAN Clustering**: Discovers organic, density-variable hotspot clusters across coordinates without administrative boundary assumptions.
4. **Propagation Modelling**: Simulates network spillover to neighboring cells using an inverse-distance weighted nearest-neighbor algorithm.
5. **Enforcement Failure Index (EFI)**: Measures the persistence of chronic violations in the face of local police precinct capacity constraints (burdened stations).
6. **Congestion Impact Score (CIS)**: Aggregates cell-level impact into Low, Medium, High, and Critical operational bands.
7. **Behavioral Archetypes (KMeans)**: Identifies 6 distinct behavioral profiles (e.g., *Junction Choke Points*, *Freight Obstruction Corridors*, *Night Spillovers*) to apply specialized policies.
8. **CatBoost Forecasting**: Regressor predicting the next-hour severity (POI sum) and Classifier predicting high-risk events.
9. **Priority Engine**: Combines all scores into a single **Final Priority Score (FPS)** to establish the daily ranked enforcement queue.

## 🕸️ Network Intelligence Layer (Pseudo-GNN)

The **Network Intelligence** module models the city's hotspot ecosystem as a similarity-weighted undirected graph containing 300 key nodes (representing the top spatial cells/hotspots). It employs a **pseudo-GNN (Graph Neural Network) neighborhood aggregation pattern** to represent and target systemic congestion.

### How it works:
1. **Node Definition**: Each node represents a distinct H3 spatial cell hotspot (e.g., Rajajinagar entrance, Anand Rao junction).
2. **Edge Construction (7D Feature Similarity)**: Edges are not drawn purely by geographical adjacency, but by behavioral similarity in a 7-dimensional feature space:
   $$X = \{\mu_{\text{POI}}, \text{CIS}, \text{Propagation Score}, \text{EFI}, \text{Heavy Vehicle Ratio}, \text{Junction Ratio}, \text{Violation Volume}\}$$
   Edges connect cells that are mutually within each other's 5 nearest neighbors in this feature space, with edge weights defined as $W_{ij} = 1 - d_{\text{cosine}}$ (cosine similarity).
3. **Pseudo-GNN Message Passing**:
   - The graph performs **spatial propagation aggregation**: each node's local congestion impact is updated by aggregating severity messages from its topological and geographical neighbors (using the inverse-distance weighted nearest-neighbor spillover).
   - This mimics the message passing layers of a Graph Neural Network (GNN), where a node's final state combines its own features with aggregated neighbor features.
4. **Structural Analysis**:
   - **PageRank Centrality**: Identifies "hub" hotspots that are connected to other highly severe, similar zones. Targeting these hubs yields cascading compliance benefits.
   - **Betweenness Centrality**: Flags "gateway" hotspots that bridge different behavioral clusters. Enforcing these nodes fragments the city's congestion graph.
   - **Community Detection**: Partitions the graph into behavioral communities (e.g., residential overflow clusters vs. industrial corridors) using the Clauset-Newman-Moore modularity maximization algorithm.

### Example Scenario:
Consider **BTP023 - Mahalaxmi Layout Entrance** (Node A) and **BTP083 - AS Char Street** (Node B). 
- Both nodes are highly active junctions showing severe loading behaviors.
- The system draws an edge between Node A and Node B because they share high similarity in their junction ratio, mean POI, and EFI (Enforcement Failure Index).
- Through the **pseudo-GNN neighborhood aggregation**, the propagation score of Node A is updated by receiving neighbor congestion metrics from Node B.
- When an enforcement officer targets Node A (Mahalaxmi Layout), the compliance behavior propagates to Node B, allowing smart-city teams to dispatch resources to structural "hubs" rather than chasing isolated incidents.

## 🌐 Deployment Instructions (Dual-Backend Microservice Architecture)

To optimize hosting cost and prevent RAM out-of-memory (OOM) errors, this platform is designed as a **split-microservices backend** targeting a single unified React frontend:
1. **Primary Backend**: A lightweight FastAPI instance that serves the KPIs, maps, and forecasts (running `requirements.txt` with NO `faiss` or `sentence-transformers`).
2. **Semantic Search Backend**: A dedicated heavy FastAPI instance running only the vector search capabilities (running `requirements-semantic.txt` which loads `faiss` and the sentence transformer embeddings).

---

### Step 1: Deploy the Primary Backend (FastAPI) to Render
This backend runs the core dashboard APIs:
1. Log in to [render.com](https://render.com/) and create a new **Web Service**. Connect this repository.
2. Configure settings:
   - **Name**: e.g., `parking-primary-backend`
   - **Root Directory**: `backend`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Installs lightweight packages only)
   - **Start Command**: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
3. Deploy the service and **copy the live URL** (e.g., `https://parking-primary-backend.onrender.com`).

---

### Step 2: Deploy the Semantic Search Backend (FastAPI) to Render
This backend runs the AI embeddings query service:
1. Log in to [render.com](https://render.com/) and create a *second* **Web Service**. Connect this repository.
2. Configure settings:
   - **Name**: e.g., `parking-semantic-backend`
   - **Root Directory**: `backend`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements-semantic.txt` (Installs FAISS and Sentence-Transformers)
   - **Start Command**: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
   - **Instance Type**: Select an instance with sufficient memory (at least 2GB of RAM is recommended to load the FAISS vectors and MiniLM transformer).
3. Deploy the service and **copy the live URL** (e.g., `https://parking-semantic-backend.onrender.com`).

---

### Step 3: Deploy the Frontend (Vite/React) to Vercel
Vercel will act as a reverse proxy, dynamically routing relative frontend paths to the correct backend microservice:
1. Log in to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and import your repository.
2. Configure settings:
   - **Framework Preset**: `Vite`
   - **Root Directory**: `frontend`
3. Edit [frontend/vercel.json](file:///a:/hackathon/gridloack%20r2/repo/Parking_Operational_Intelligence/frontend/vercel.json) in your repository and set the `destination` URLs to match your deployed services:
   ```json
   {
     "rewrites": [
       {
         "source": "/api/search",
         "destination": "https://parking-semantic-backend.onrender.com/api/search"
       },
       {
         "source": "/api/:path*",
         "destination": "https://parking-primary-backend.onrender.com/api/:path*"
       },
       {
         "source": "/(.*)",
         "destination": "/index.html"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
4. Deploy the project on Vercel. Now, when the browser makes API requests:
   - Queries to `/api/search` are routed to the **Semantic Search Backend**.
   - All other API queries are routed to the **Primary Backend**.
   - No CORS errors occur, and no frontend environment variables are required!
